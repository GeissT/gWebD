gWebD is a small WebServer based off of the sources available at
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/mywebserver.aspx

gWeb has been tested to run on Ubuntu Linux, it will need to be
tested on Windows to ensure that all features work. The directories
in the code point to directories used by the Linux Kernel and the ext4
filesystem.

You will need to have the folder structure like this:

gWebD
   |
   |-----Sites // you will need to create this folder.
   |
   |-----APP // The folder with the application in it.
          |
          |-----Data // This contains important files that allow the server to function.
          |
          |-----gWebD.exe // The main application
